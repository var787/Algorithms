# Sorted Squared Array

### Level: Easy
### Optimal: O(n) time | O(n) space - where n is the length of the input array

Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of integers that are sorted in ascending order and returns a new array of the same length with the squares of the original integers also sorted in ascending order.
